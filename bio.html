          <p class="bio-main-content">I was born in Brasov, Romania. I lived there
          for 18 years there. I finished one of the most prestigious high school
          from my country, however when the time came, I felt that there is so
          much more outside of Brasov, outside of Romania. That was the time when
          I have applied for an AP degree in Computer Science at the Copenhagen
          School of Design and Technology./<p>

          <p class="bio-main-content">One year later, I realised that there
          is still so much more to be explored, to be uncovered, to be understood
          and to be learned, so I am on my way to spend a semester in Canada,
          studying yet again Computer Science.</p>

          <p class="bio-main-content">As you might have noticed by now, my interests
            revolve around computers and the digital world. I am an avid reader
            and I generally think that it is essential for me, and humans in general,
            to learn something new everyday. I am keen on proving myself to me, and to everybody else.
            That is why I would rather not do something if I know that I will not be
            involved in it 100%.</p>

          <p>My hobbies are reading, writing and studying new programming languages.
            I also enjoy cooking and luckily I have been working for the last year
            and a half as a cook in an Italian restaurant. I want to make the most
            out of my time and I am open minded when it comes to trying new
            things...</p>
